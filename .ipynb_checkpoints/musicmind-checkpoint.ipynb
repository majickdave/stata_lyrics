       "(5821, [, , NOTE: CHECK OUT MY NEWER & BETTER REVIEWZ HERE, THIS REVIEW IS OLD, , If youâ€™re trying to find a true representative for hip-hop, this to me is the album. Whatâ€™s unique about it, of course, is that you have 9 upper echelon MCâ€™s bringing their skills to the battlefield, and each one is trying to outdo the other on the track, making for some of the greatest lyrical exchanges in any hip-hop album. The beats here are dirty, raw, gritty and very bare-boned. The genius here lies in its simplicity, and really allows the rappers to shine through. While the majority of the tracks on here are dedicated to a lyrical exercise, some tracks are deeper than that, talking about the ills of society, the pressures growing up and what it takes to survive said harsh conditions (see: Can It Be All So Simple and C.R.E.A.M.). Some of the more impressive tracks are those that feature most of the Clan e.g. â€˜Da Mystery of Chessboxinâ€™, â€˜Protect Ya Neckâ€™ and â€˜7th Chamberâ€™. Two of the tracks are solo tracks: GZAâ€™s â€˜Clan in Da Frontâ€™ and Method Manâ€™s â€™M.E.T.H.O.D. Man'. The skit at the end of â€˜Can It Be All So SImpleâ€™, largely narrated by Meth himself, really gives insight into the uniqueness of each member of the Clan. GZA is the lyrical master, the voltron head and one of the best verse closers in hip-hop as exhibited on â€˜Bring Da Ruckusâ€™, â€˜7th Chamberâ€™ and â€˜Protect Ya Neckâ€™. Inspectah Deck is also lyrically proficient, often catching the listenerâ€™s attention from the start (also on â€˜Protect Ya Neckâ€™). The RZA, while mostly a producer, lays down a number of impressive verses (see: â€˜Tearzâ€™ and â€˜Wu-Tang Clan Ainâ€™t Nuthin Ta Fuck Witâ€™). Raekwon and Ghostface are the slang spitters and colourful storytellers of the group. Method Man and ODB might be the most charismatic of them all, each in their own way. U-God and Masta Killa are often forgotten, but both do a great job on â€˜Da Mystery of Chessboxinâ€™, especially Masta Killa, who pretty much as a part-timer at the time renegades the whole Clan with arguably the best verse on the album. The album is never boring, and every track can be played on its own numerous times. Every MC brings their A-game, as does the RZA in production, and it still stands the test of time 22 years later. If any album deserves to be the â€˜magnum opusâ€™ of hip-hop, itâ€™s 36 Chambers, , -InspectahDUCK, , , , #/Title/SwineLord Rating/InspectahDUCK Rating, 1. Bring Da Ruckus- /5/5, 2.
